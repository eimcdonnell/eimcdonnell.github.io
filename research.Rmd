My background has allowed me to explore a broad range of research areas. Clinical topics range from neurodegenerative diseases to oncology to autism and beyond. In terms of statistical methodology, my current interests include functional data analysis (FDA), causal inference, and statistical learning.

### Functional data analysis (FDA)

FDA is a type of data analysis where the unit of observation is a curve rather than a single data point from a subject. I am currently working on two projects in this area: 

1. Motivated by accelerometer data, which can be visualized as a curve of physical activity intensity over the course of a day for each subject, my project involves exploring new parametric methods of "registering" or aligning these subject-specific curves in order to make inferences about the patterns of peaks and valleys (under the guidance of Dr. Jeff Goldsmith).

1. I am conducting a simulation study to compare several FDA-specific approaches for principal components analysis (under the guidance of Dr. Todd Ogden).

### Causal inference

Causal inference is the study of how a particular variable *causes* the outcome to change, rather than the study of how that variable is simply *associated* with the outcome. It is a heavily epidemiology-based methodology. 

As a masters student, my thesis project involved fitting a structural nested model to estimate the effect of feeding tube placement on survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the presence of time-varying confounding (under the guidance of Dr. David Schoenfeld). 

Here at Columbia, I continue to study causal methods with peers and faculty as an active member of the Causal Inference Working Group.

### Statistical learning

This is an area I have only recently begun to explore through my coursework. I am currently embarking on a new project involving Gaussian graphical modeling to build a symptom network in a psychiatry context (under the guidance of Dr. Yuanjia Wang).
