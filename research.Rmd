My background has allowed me to explore a broad range of research areas. Clinical topics range from neurodegenerative diseases and oncology to autism and beyond. Regarding statistical methodology, my current interests include functional data analysis (FDA), causal inference, and statistical learning.

### Functional data analysis (FDA)

FDA is a type of data analysis where the unit of observation is a curve rather than a single data point from a subject. I am currently working on two projects in this area: 

1. I am conducting a simulation study to compare several FDA-specific approaches for principal components analysis (under the guidance of Dr. Todd Ogden).

1. Motivated by accelerometer data, which can be visualized as a curve of physical activity intensity over the course of a day for each subject, I am exploring new parametric methods of "registering" or aligning these subject-specific curves (under the guidance of Dr. Jeff Goldsmith).

### Causal inference

Causal inference is the study of how an exposure of interest *causes* the outcome of interest, rather than a mere *association*. It is an epidemiological methodology that takes into account pathways of relationships between all variables, independent and dependent, measured and unmeasured. 

As a masters student, my thesis project involved fitting a structural nested model to estimate the effect of feeding tube placement on survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the presence of time-varying confounding (under the guidance of Dr. David Schoenfeld). 

Here at Columbia, I continue to study causal methods with peers and faculty as an active member of the Causal Inference Working Group.

### Statistical learning

Statistical learning is a branch of methodology encompassing tools used in data mining and machine learning. This is an area I have only recently begun to explore in-depth through my coursework. I am currently embarking on a new project involving Gaussian graphical modeling with a psychiatry application (under the guidance of Dr. Yuanjia Wang).
