Hello! I'm Erin. I am a second-year PhD student in biostatistics at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics). I obtained my MS in biostatistics from [Harvard University](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) in 2014 and my BS in mathematics from [Christopher Newport University](http://cnu.edu/) in 2011. 

Before starting my PhD, I spent several years as a biostatistician at [Massachusetts General Hospital](http://hedwig.mgh.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) and an analyst in [Analysis Group](http://www.analysisgroup.com/practices/health-care/health-economics-outcomes-research-heor/)'s Health Economics and Outcomes Research practice. I am skilled in both SAS and R, and have experience in the design and analysis of clinical trials, longitudinal observational studies, electronic health records, and insurance claims databases. 

My current research interests include functional data analysis, causal inference, and statistical learning. I also enjoy teaching, and have served as lead teaching assistant for two graduate-level courses: Data Science I and Pharmaceutical Statistics.
